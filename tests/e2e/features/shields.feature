Feature: Shields endpoint tests

  Tests for the LCORE-owned GET /v1/shields catalog endpoint. These shields
  (question_validity, redaction, granite_guardian) are configured directly in
  lightspeed-stack.yaml; they are not OGX Safety API resources.
  See docs/user_doc/shields_guide.md for the full shield configuration and
  runtime-behavior reference.

  Background:
    Given The service is started locally
      And The system is in default state
      And REST API service prefix is /v1
      And the Lightspeed stack configuration directory is "tests/e2e/configuration"

  @cfg_shields
  Scenario: Shields endpoint returns every configured shield type
    Given The service uses the lightspeed-stack-shields.yaml configuration
      And The service is restarted
     When I access REST API endpoint "shields" using HTTP GET method
     Then The status code of the response is 200
      And The body of the response is the following
