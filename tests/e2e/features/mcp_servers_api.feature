Feature: MCP Server Management API tests

  Tests for the dynamic MCP server management endpoints:
  POST /v1/mcp-servers, GET /v1/mcp-servers, DELETE /v1/mcp-servers/{name}

  Background:
    Given The service is started locally
      And The system is in default state
      And REST API service prefix is /v1
      And the Lightspeed stack configuration directory is "tests/e2e/configuration"
      And The service uses the lightspeed-stack-mcp.yaml configuration
      And The service is restarted

  Scenario: List MCP servers returns pre-configured servers
    When I access REST API endpoint "mcp-servers" using HTTP GET method
    Then The status code of the response is 200
    And The body of the response contains mcp-oauth
    And The body of the response contains config

  Scenario: List MCP servers response has expected structure
    When I access REST API endpoint "mcp-servers" using HTTP GET method
    Then The status code of the response is 200
    And the body of the response has the following structure
    """
    {
        "servers": [
            {

  Scenario: Delete statically configured MCP server returns 403
    When I access REST API endpoint "mcp-servers/mcp-oauth" using HTTP DELETE method
    Then The status code of the response is 403
    And The body of the response contains statically configured

  Scenario: Delete non-existent MCP server returns 404
    When I access REST API endpoint "mcp-servers/non-existent-server" using HTTP DELETE method
    Then The status code of the response is 404
    And The body of the response contains Mcp Server not found

  Scenario: Register MCP server with missing required fields returns 422
    When I access REST API endpoint "mcp-servers" using HTTP POST method

    """
    Then The status code of the response is 422
