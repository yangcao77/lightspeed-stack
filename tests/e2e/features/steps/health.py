    Disrupts the Llama Stack service by stopping its Docker container and

    Checks whether the Docker container named "llama-stack" is running; if it
    is, stops the container, waits briefly for the disruption to take effect,
    and sets `context.llama_stack_was_running` to True so callers can restore
    state later. If the container is not running, the flag remains False. On
    failure to run Docker commands, prints a warning message describing the
    error.
