"""Step definitions for the conversation-compaction e2e feature (LCORE-2230).

Everything here observes compaction from outside the deployed stack — the
``context_status`` field on responses, the ``compaction`` event on the native
stream, and the conversation history the Conversations API serves. Steps
never import from or execute anything under ``src/``
(``docs/testing/e2e_testing.md``, "Choosing the Test Layer"); the internals
(buffer, additive summaries, blocking) are integration tests (LCORE-1574).
