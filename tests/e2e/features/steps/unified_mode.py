"""Step definitions for the unified-mode e2e features (LCORE-2343).

Only the startup-log evidence step lives here. Everything else the four
``unified-mode-*.feature`` files need — applying a configuration, restarting
containers, hitting ``readiness`` and ``query`` — resolves through the generic
steps, and the configuration validation, migration and synthesis assertions
moved to ``tests/integration/`` (``test_unified_mode_cli.py``,
``test_unified_synthesis.py``): e2e steps observe the deployed stack from
outside and never import from or execute anything under ``src/``. See
``docs/testing/e2e_testing.md``, "Choosing the Test Layer".

The log step is mode-aware: in server mode the synthesis evidence is emitted by
the ogx container (entrypoint + config CLI), not the lightspeed-stack
container the Gherkin names; the scenario's intent (R10: the synthesized path
is logged at startup) is asserted against the container that actually
synthesizes.

    """Assert the container that synthesizes logged the synthesized-config path.

    Library mode: the lightspeed-stack container itself synthesizes in-process
    and logs "Using synthesized OGX config at <path>". Server mode: synthesis
    happens in the ogx container (entrypoint + config CLI), which
    echoes the generated-config path — the Gherkin names lightspeed-stack, but
    the scenario's intent (R10: the path is logged at startup) can only be
    observed on the synthesizing container. Deviation agreed in planning (Q2).

    ``docker logs`` accumulates across ``docker restart``, and the CI baseline
    configurations already synthesize (library) or generate (server) on the
    very first compose boot — so an unscoped read would pass on evidence from
    an earlier boot. The read is therefore limited to lines since the
    container's current ``StartedAt``, i.e. the restart the scenario just
    performed under the unified fixture.

    The pattern must carry a path and must be unique to synthesis. The
    entrypoint's own lines cannot provide that: it echoes "(mode
    auto-detected)" before generation runs and unconditionally, and it echoes
    "Using generated config: <path>" identically for the synthesis and the
    legacy-enrichment branch (scripts/ogx-entrypoint.sh). Matching either
    would let the scenario pass when the unified fixture never reached the
    container and the entrypoint enriched a run.yaml instead — which is the
    one thing this scenario exists to rule out. The fallback line "Using
    original config:" does not discriminate either; it is printed only when
    generation *failed*, so it is absent from a successful enrichment too.

    So both modes match a line that only the synthesis path writes:
    src/client/ogx.py in library mode, src/ogx_configuration.py in server
    mode. The latter reaches the container log only because main() configures
    logging — as a bare script nothing installs a root handler and
    logging.lastResort drops everything below WARNING.
