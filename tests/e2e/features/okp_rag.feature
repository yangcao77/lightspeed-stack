Feature: OKP(Solr) RAG retrieval tests
  # Offline Knowledge Portal (OKP) provides a Solr-backed RAG source to LSC.
  # Tests verify that Lightspeed Stack can use OKP for both Inline RAG
  # (context injected before the LLM request) and Tool RAG (context
  # retrieved on demand via file_search), in both offline and online modes.
  
  Background:
    Given The service is started locally
      And The system is in default state
      And OKP(Solr) server is running
      And I set the Authorization header to Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6Ikpva
      And REST API service prefix is /v1
      And the Lightspeed stack configuration directory is "tests/e2e/configuration"
