  Functional tests for `granite_guardian` shield.

  Scenario: granite_guardian allows a legitimate in-topic question
    Given The service uses the lightspeed-stack-shields.yaml configuration
      And The service is restarted
    When I use "query" to ask question

    Then The status code of the response is 200
      And The body of the response contains cluster
      And The body of the response does not contain That phrasing is not something I can act on.
