Feature: conversations endpoint API tests

  Background:
    Given The service is started locally
      And The system is in default state
      And I set the Authorization header to Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6Ikpva
      And REST API service prefix is /v1
      And the Lightspeed stack configuration directory is "tests/e2e/configuration"
      And The service uses the lightspeed-stack-auth-noop-token.yaml configuration
      And The service is restarted


  Scenario: Check if conversations endpoint finds the correct conversation when it exists
    And I use "query" to ask question with authorization header

     And The conversation details are following
