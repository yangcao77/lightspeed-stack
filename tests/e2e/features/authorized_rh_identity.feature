Feature: Authorized endpoint API tests for the rh-identity authentication module

  Background:
    Given The service is started locally
      And The system is in default state
      And REST API service prefix is /v1
      And the Lightspeed stack configuration directory is "tests/e2e/configuration"
      And The service uses the lightspeed-stack-auth-rh-identity.yaml configuration
      And The service is restarted

  Scenario: Request fails when identity field is missing
