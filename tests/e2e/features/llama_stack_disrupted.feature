Feature: Llama Stack connection disrupted

  End-to-end scenarios that stop the Llama Stack container (or simulate disconnect) and
  assert degraded responses (503, readiness, etc.). Config order matches test_list.txt:
  default stack, then noop-token (query/conversations/…), then rbac (rlsapi errors), then
  mcp (immediately before mcp.feature). Skipped in library mode.

  Background:
    Given The service is started locally
      And The system is in default state
      And REST API service prefix is /v1
      And the Lightspeed stack configuration directory is "tests/e2e/configuration"
