Feature: Responses endpoint streaming API tests

# Same coverage as ``responses.feature`` with ``stream=true`` (SSE for success paths;

  Background:
    Given The service is started locally
      And The system is in default state
      And I set the Authorization header to Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6Ikpva
      And REST API service prefix is /v1
      And the Lightspeed stack configuration directory is "tests/e2e/configuration"
      And The service uses the lightspeed-stack-auth-noop-token.yaml configuration
      And The service is restarted
