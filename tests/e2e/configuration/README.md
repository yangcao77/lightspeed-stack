# E2E Test Configuration Files

This directory contains configuration files used for end-to-end testing of Lightspeed Core.

## Directory Structure

- `server-mode/` - Configurations for testing when LCore connects to a separate OGX service
- `library-mode/` - Configurations for testing when LCore embeds OGX as a library

## Library mode uses unified configs (LCORE-2342)

The library-mode configurations use the unified single-file format: instead of
the legacy `ogx.library_client_config_path` (the deprecated `llama_stack` YAML
section alias is still accepted), they carry

```yaml
ogx:
  use_as_library_client: true
  config:
    profile: run.yaml
```

The harness/CI copies the provider-specific run config
(`tests/e2e/configs/run-<environment>.yaml`) to `./run.yaml` in the repo root,
and the active `lightspeed-stack.yaml` is also copied to the repo root — so the
relative `profile:` path resolves to that materialized file, which the unified
synthesizer consumes as its baseline. LS behavior is identical to the legacy
two-file path (requirement R7 in the config-merge design doc); the wiring that
selects a provider config stays unchanged. The synthesizer also ensures the
MCP `tool_runtime` provider (`model-context-protocol`) is present on the
profile baseline when missing; many `run-*.yaml` fixtures already include it,
so the ensure is typically a no-op.

The `tests/e2e/configs/run-*.yaml` files therefore serve a dual role: in
server mode they are the run configuration of the standalone OGX
service, and in library mode they are consumed as the unified-mode synthesis
profile. No in-repo test config references them via the legacy mechanism
anymore.

## Common Configuration Features

### Default Configurations (`lightspeed-stack.yaml`)

Both server-mode and library-mode default configurations include:

1. **MCP Servers** - Used for testing MCP-related endpoints:
   - `github-api` - Uses client-provided auth (Authorization header)
   - `gitlab-api` - Uses client-provided auth (X-API-Token header)
   - `k8s-service` - Uses kubernetes auth (not client-provided)
   - `public-api` - No authentication (not client-provided)

   These servers test the `/v1/mcp-auth/client-options` endpoint, which should return only servers accepting client-provided authentication (`github-api` and `gitlab-api`).

2. **Authentication** - Set to `noop` for most tests

3. **User Data Collection** - Enabled for feedback and transcripts testing

### Config variants (`@cfg_*` tags)

Named configs merge compatible options and map to `@cfg_*` Behave tags so CI
can shard by config (fewer restarts per job). See
[grouped/README.md](grouped/README.md).

| Config | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lightspeed-stack-default.yaml` | Default + inline RAG |
| `lightspeed-stack-authorized.yaml` | Authorization (noop-token) |
| `lightspeed-stack-negative.yaml` | No cache + invalid feedback storage |
| `lightspeed-stack-rbac.yaml` | RBAC (jwk-token auth) |
| `lightspeed-stack-rh-identity.yaml` | RH Identity header auth |
| `lightspeed-stack-skills.yaml` / `-skills-directory.yaml` | Agent skills |
| `lightspeed-stack-mcp.yaml` | All valid MCP servers (`mcp_servers_api`) |
| `lightspeed-stack-mcp-invalid.yaml` | Invalid MCP file token |
| `lightspeed-stack-mcp-api-auth.yaml` | MCP server API auth |
| `lightspeed-stack-mcp-{file,kubernetes,client,oauth}-auth.yaml` | Per-auth MCP (`mcp.feature`) |
| `lightspeed-stack-byok-pdf.yaml` | BYOK PDF (library only) |
| `lightspeed-stack-tls.yaml` / `-degraded.yaml` | TLS / degraded mode (server only) |
| `lightspeed-stack-shields.yaml` | LCORE shields (`question_validity`, `redaction`, `granite_guardian`). CI points `granite_guardian` at `mock-guardian`. |

Bootstrap default: `lightspeed-stack.yaml`. Environment-specific:
`lightspeed-stack-rhelai.yaml`, `lightspeed-stack-rhoai.yaml`.
