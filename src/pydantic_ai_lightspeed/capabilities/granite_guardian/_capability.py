class GraniteGuardian(AbstractSafetyCapability):
    """Safety capability using Granite Guardian for risk-based moderation.

    Uses Granite Guardian's logprob-based scoring to evaluate text against
    configured risk categories. When used as a pydantic-ai capability:

    - ``wrap_run`` applies INPUT-point risks to the user prompt before the
      real run starts.
    - ``wrap_run_event_stream`` applies OUTPUT-point risks to the generated
      response, checking each newly generated chunk roughly every
      ``config.streaming_output_check_interval_tokens`` tokens (plus a final
      check over any remainder), so a violation partway through generation
      stops the response before any more of it is released to the caller.
      Each check screens only the chunk generated since the previous check
      (not the whole response so far), so Guardian's workload stays linear
      in the response length instead of growing quadratically. None of the
      currently configured risk categories require cross-chunk context; if
      one ever does, that risk should carry its own overlap/context handling
      rather than reintroducing full-history re-checks for every risk.
    - ``after_tool_execute`` applies TOOL-point risks to each tool call's
      result once it's returned, screening content coming back from tools
      (e.g. MCP servers) before it can flow into the model's context.

    Any of these checks short-circuits the run with the same kind of
    rejection result. The ``run`` method provides a standalone shield
    interface for use outside the agent lifecycle (see
    ``run_moderation_guardrail_point``).

        """Screen streamed output against OUTPUT-point risks as it's generated.

        Text is buffered until ``config.streaming_output_check_interval_tokens``
        tokens accumulate, then that chunk (not the whole response so far) is
        checked against every OUTPUT-point risk. Events are released only
        after their text clears a check. A final check covers any remainder
        when the stream ends. When no OUTPUT-point risks are configured,
        events pass through unchanged. An event that contributes no text
        (e.g. a tool-call event) is also released immediately as long as no
        text is currently buffered; once text is pending, later non-text
        events are held with it and released together once that text clears.

        Checking only the newly generated chunk on each interval (instead of
        re-sending everything checked so far) keeps Guardian's workload
        linear in the response length. It does mean risky content split
        exactly across a check boundary could, in principle, evade detection;
        none of the currently configured risk categories require that kind
        of cross-chunk context. Token counts are accumulated per fragment
        (not by re-tokenizing the whole pending chunk on every event), so
        checking-interval bookkeeping also stays linear.

        On a mid-stream violation, the remainder of ``stream`` is drained
        (see ``_drain_remaining``) before the violation is raised, so the
        underlying provider call reaches natural completion -- giving
        accurate usage totals and letting OGX's own turn-persistence
        complete -- rather than being cut off mid-generation. Only the
        *content* is withheld from the caller.

        Parameters:
            ctx: The run context for the current agent run (unused).
            stream: The underlying agent stream to guard.

        Yields:
            Events from ``stream`` once their text has cleared guardrails. A
            synthetic ``PartEndEvent`` carrying the violation message is
            yielded immediately before raising, so callers that build up a
            response from stream events (e.g. conversation persistence) see
            the rejection text instead of an empty response.

        Screening the result -- rather than the call's arguments -- guards

        that could otherwise flow into the model's context unchecked, such
        as prompt-injection payloads embedded in fetched content.

        ``after_tool_execute`` (not ``wrap_tool_execute``) is used so a

        response -- OGX calls the tool, gets its result, and hands
        pydantic-ai a ``ModelResponse`` that already contains both the call
        and its ``NativeToolReturnPart`` result. Because pydantic-ai never
        invokes a tool function itself in that case, ``after_tool_execute``
        (which only fires around pydantic-ai's own tool-execution machinery)
        never sees that result. This hook closes that gap by screening every
        ``NativeToolReturnPart`` in the response directly -- except MCP
        ``list_tools`` discovery calls, which carry no tool-produced content
        and are never evaluated (see ``_is_mcp_list_tools_call``).

                this response (unused).

            _ToolGuardrailViolation: When a TOOL-point risk is violated.
                Every native tool call/return pair from this response is
                preserved on the exception so the rejection's ``tool_calls``
                still shows what else was called -- but starting from the
                pair that actually violated the risk, every return part from
                that point on (including later pairs never even checked) is
                replaced with a content-stripped, ``outcome="denied"``
                placeholder (pydantic-ai only recognizes a native call
                alongside a matching return, so the call can't be preserved
                without one). Once one result is flagged, later results in
                the same response are treated as suspect too and withheld,
                even if they'd individually pass the risk check. Pairs
                before the violation are unaffected.

                pydantic-ai only merges a model response's usage into
                ``ctx.usage`` once it has passed every ``after_model_request``
                hook without error (see its ``_finish_handling``): raising
                here skips that step entirely, which would otherwise make the
                already-completed model call's tokens vanish from the run's
                (and therefore the rejected turn's) usage totals. ``response``
                is already the final, non-streaming result at this point, so
