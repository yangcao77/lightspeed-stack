    Create a JWK key resolver used to locate the verification key from a KeySet.

    The returned callable accepts a JWT header and payload and selects a key from the provided
    jwk_set. If the header contains a `kid`, the resolver returns the single key with that `kid`
    and verifies the key's `alg` matches the header `alg`. If `kid` is absent, the resolver
    returns the first key that matches the header `alg`. The resolver raises `KeyNotFoundError`
    if no suitable key is found or if multiple keys are found for the same `kid`.

    Parameters:
        jwk_set (KeySet): JWK set to search for verification keys.
