"""Runtime integration of conversation compaction into the request flow.

This module wires the pure compaction primitives (``utils.compaction``,
LCORE-1570) and the token estimator (``utils.token_estimator``, LCORE-1569)
into the actual request path (LCORE-1572). Unlike ``utils.compaction`` — which
is deliberately side-effect free — this module *does* touch conversation state:
it fetches conversation items from OGX, calls the summarization LLM,
writes summary marker items, reads and writes summaries in the cache, and holds
a per-conversation lock.

Design (see ``docs/design/conversation-compaction/conversation-compaction.md``):

* **Option A — lightspeed owns the context after compaction.** Once a
  conversation has been compacted, lightspeed-stack stops handing the
  ``conversation`` parameter to OGX (which would otherwise reload the
  full message history and defeat compaction). Instead it builds the model
  input explicitly from the summaries plus the recent verbatim turns. The
  conversation identity (``conversation_id``) is preserved, and the full
  history remains in OGX's conversation *items* for UI/audit.

* **Marker items track the boundary.** Each compaction writes the summary into
  the conversation as a recognizable *marker* message (a message whose text
  starts with ``MARKER_SENTINEL``) recording how many leading items it covers.
  The items past that count are the recent verbatim turns; the marker texts are
  the additive summaries. This is
  lightspeed's own bookkeeping — OGX never interprets it (we no longer
  pass ``conversation`` to inference once a marker exists).

* **Streaming notification.** When driven by the streaming endpoint, this
  module yields a :class:`CompactionStartedEvent` *before* the summarization
  LLM call so the client can show a progress indicator (R12). The non-streaming
  wrapper :func:`apply_compaction_blocking` simply ignores those events.

The cache (LCORE-1571) is the preferred source of truth for summaries and the
home of the persisted recursive fold (R3): each summary chunk is written to it,
the active summary set is read back from it, and when the summaries themselves
grow past the threshold they are folded into one and persisted via
``replace_summaries`` so the fold is reused rather than recomputed. When no
persisting cache is configured (or a cache read fails) the module falls back to
the OGX marker texts, which remain authoritative — marker-only mode
keeps additive summaries with no fold. The marker items always carry the
boundary between summarized history and the recent verbatim turns.

    single :class:`CompactionResult` as its final item.

            the persisted recursive fold. ``None`` (or a non-persisting backend)
            falls back to marker-only summaries with no folding.
        user_id: User identifier for cache reads/writes.
