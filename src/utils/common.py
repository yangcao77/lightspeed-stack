    Register MCP (Model Context Protocol) toolgroups with a LlamaStack async client.

    Checks the client's existing toolgroups and registers any servers from `mcp_servers`
    whose `name` is not present in the client's `provider_resource_id` list. For each
    new server it calls the client's toolgroups.register with parameters:
    `toolgroup_id`=`mcp.name`, `provider_id`=`mcp.provider_id`, and
    `mcp_endpoint` containing the server `url`.

    This function performs network calls against the provided async client and does not
    catch exceptions raised by those calls — any exceptions from the client (e.g., RPC
    or HTTP errors) will propagate to the caller.

    Parameters:
        client (AsyncLlamaStackClient): The LlamaStack async client used to
                                        query and register toolgroups.
