## A2AStateConfiguration


A2A protocol persistent state configuration.

Configures how A2A task state and context-to-conversation mappings are
stored. For multi-worker deployments, use SQLite or PostgreSQL to ensure
state is shared across all workers.

If no configuration is provided, in-memory storage is used (default).
This is suitable for single-worker deployments but state will be lost
on restarts and not shared across workers.

Useful resources:

  - [CORS in FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/)
  - [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)

## CompactionConfiguration


Configuration for conversation history compaction.

Compaction summarizes older conversation turns when their estimated
token count approaches the context window limit, keeping the
conversation usable instead of failing with HTTP 413. The
configuration here controls when compaction triggers and how much
recent context is preserved verbatim.

Attributes:
    enabled: Master switch. When False, compaction never triggers
        and other fields are inert.
    threshold_ratio: Trigger compaction when estimated input tokens
        exceed this fraction of the model's context window
        (clamped to 0.0..1.0).
    token_floor: Minimum estimated token count before compaction
        can trigger, regardless of threshold_ratio. Prevents
        triggering on very small context windows.
    buffer_turns: Initial number of recent turns to keep verbatim.
        The runtime applies a degrading guard — if these turns
        exceed the available budget, it reduces buffer_turns by
        one repeatedly until the budget fits, down to zero.
    buffer_max_ratio: Hard cap on the fraction of the context
        window the buffer zone may occupy, regardless of
        buffer_turns.


| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| enabled | boolean | When true, older conversation turns are summarized when estimated tokens approach the context window limit. |
| threshold_ratio | number | Trigger compaction when estimated tokens exceed this fraction of the model's context window (0.0-1.0). |
| token_floor | integer | Minimum token count before compaction can trigger. Prevents triggering on very small context windows. |
| buffer_turns | integer | Number of recent turns to keep verbatim. |
| buffer_max_ratio | number | Maximum fraction of context window the buffer zone can occupy, regardless of buffer_turns. |


## Configuration


Global service configuration.


| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| name | string | Name of the service. That value will be used in REST API endpoints. |
| config_format_version | string | Optional explicit marker of the configuration format. When set, it must agree with the shape detected from the configuration body: 'unified' requires a synthesis input (a non-empty inference.providers, a non-empty vector_store.providers, or an ogx.config block), 'legacy' requires no synthesis input. Reserved as the lever for a future breaking change of the unified schema (R11). |
| service |  | This section contains Lightspeed Core Stack service configuration. |
| ogx |  | This section contains OGX configuration. Lightspeed Core Stack service can call OGX in library mode or in server mode. |
| user_data_collection |  | This section contains configuration for subsystem that collects user data(transcription history and feedbacks). |
| database |  | Configuration for database to store conversation IDs and other runtime data |
| mcp_servers | array | MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide tools and capabilities to the AI agents. These are configured in this section. Only MCP servers defined in the lightspeed-stack.yaml configuration are available to the agents. Tools configured in the OGX run.yaml are not accessible to lightspeed-core agents. |
| authentication |  | Authentication configuration |
| authorization |  | Lightspeed Core Stack implements a modular authentication and authorization system with multiple authentication methods. Authorization is configurable through role-based access control. Authentication is handled through selectable modules configured via the module field in the authentication configuration. |
| customization |  | It is possible to customize Lightspeed Core Stack via this section. System prompt can be customized and also different parts of the service can be replaced by custom Python modules. |
| inference |  | One LLM provider and one its model might be selected as default ones. When no provider+model pair is specified in REST API calls (query endpoints), the default provider and model are used. |
| conversation_cache |  |  |
| compaction |  | Controls when conversation history is summarized to keep the model's input below the context window limit. Disabled by default — when disabled, requests that exceed the window continue to surface as HTTP 413. |
| approvals |  | Settings for human-in-the-loop approval of MCP tool invocations |
| vector_store |  | Dynamic vector-store provider capacity for runtime POST /v1/vector-stores creates. Not the same as rag.byok.stores (static registered corpora). When providers is non-empty, default_provider is required and must match one of providers[].id. Applied in unified synthesis only. |

## ModelContextProtocolServer


Model context protocol server configuration.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide tools and capabilities to the
AI agents. These are configured by this structure. Only MCP servers
defined in the lightspeed-stack.yaml configuration are available to the
agents. Tools configured in the OGX run.yaml are not accessible to
lightspeed-core agents.

Useful resources:

- [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)
- [MCP FAQs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/faqs)
- [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol)

| provider_id | string | MCP provider identification |
| url | string | URL of the MCP server |
| authorization_headers | object | Headers to send to the MCP server. The map contains the header name and the path to a file containing the header value (secret). There are 3 special cases: 1. Usage of the kubernetes token in the header. To specify this use a string 'kubernetes' instead of the file path. 2. Usage of the client-provided token in the header. To specify this use a string 'client' instead of the file path. 3. Usage of the oauth token in the header. To specify this use a string 'oauth' instead of the file path.  |
| headers | array | List of HTTP header names to automatically forward from the incoming request to this MCP server. Headers listed here are extracted from the original client request and included when calling the MCP server. This is useful when infrastructure components (e.g. API gateways) inject headers that MCP servers need, such as x-rh-identity in HCC. Header matching is case-insensitive. These headers are additive with authorization_headers and MCP-HEADERS. |
| require_approval |  | When to require human approval for tool invocations. 'always' requires approval for all tools, 'never' auto-approves, or use ApprovalFilter for granular control. |
| timeout | integer | Timeout in seconds for requests to the MCP server. If not specified, the default timeout from OGX will be used. Note: This field is reserved for future use when OGX adds timeout support. |

| library_client_config_path | string | Path to configuration file used when OGX is run in library mode. DEPRECATED legacy two-file setup: logs a startup warning since 0.6 and is removed in 0.8 — use unified mode instead (the config block below, and/or the root-level inference.providers section); migrate with lightspeed-stack --migrate-config. |
| timeout | integer | Timeout in seconds for requests to OGX service. Default is 180 seconds (3 minutes) to accommodate long-running RAG queries. |

   for all possible options. When the end of the period is reached, the
   quota is reset or increased.
2. ``initial_quota`` is the value set at the beginning of the period.
3. ``quota_increase`` is the value (if specified) used to increase the
   quota when the period is reached.

There are two basic use cases:

1. When the quota needs to be reset to a specific value periodically (for

   required value.
2. When the quota needs to be increased by a specific value periodically
   (for example on a daily basis), set ``quota_increase``.

:param score_threshold: (Optional) Minimum relevance score threshold for results. Default: 0.0
:param alpha: (Optional) Weight factor for weighted ranker (0-1).
    - 0.0 = keyword only
    - 0.5 = equal weight (default)
    - 1.0 = vector only
    Only used when ranker="weighted" and weights is not provided.
    Falls back to VectorStoresConfig.chunk_retrieval_params.weighted_search_alpha if not provided.

## ServiceConfiguration


Service configuration.

Lightspeed Core Stack is a REST API service that accepts requests on a
specified hostname and port. It is also possible to enable authentication
and specify the number of Uvicorn workers. When more workers are specified,
the service can handle requests concurrently.


| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| host | string | Service hostname |
| port | integer | Service port |
| base_url | string | Externally reachable base URL for the service; needed for A2A support. |
| auth_enabled | boolean | Enables the authentication subsystem |
| workers | integer | Number of Uvicorn worker processes to start |
| max_concurrent_file_uploads | integer | Maximum number of file uploads (POST /v1/files) processed concurrently per worker. Each in-flight upload can hold up to the configured maximum file size in memory, so this bounds worst-case memory usage from concurrent uploads. Additional uploads are rejected with 429 until a slot frees up. |
| max_concurrent_vector_store_attaches | integer | Maximum number of vector store file attachments (POST /v1/vector-stores/{id}/files) processed concurrently per worker. Each in-flight attachment re-reads and chunks the source file, so this bounds worst-case memory usage independently of max_concurrent_file_uploads. Additional attachments are rejected with 429 until a slot frees up. |
| delete_file_after_vector_store_attach | boolean | When true, deletes a file (POST /v1/files) once it has been successfully attached to a vector store, since the vector store keeps its own chunked/embedded copy of the content. Defaults to false to match the OpenAI Files API, where a file remains reusable across multiple vector stores until the caller explicitly deletes it - enabling this makes attached files single-use: re-attaching the same file_id to another vector store will fail once it has been deleted. |
| color_log | boolean | Enables colorized logging |
| access_log | boolean | Enables logging of all access information |
| tls_config |  | Transport Layer Security configuration for HTTPS support |
| root_path | string | ASGI root path for serving behind a reverse proxy on a subpath |

## TLSConfiguration


TLS configuration.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to
provide communications security over a computer network, such as the
Internet. The protocol is widely used in applications such as email,
instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use in securing HTTPS remains
the most publicly visible.

## UnifiedInferenceProvider


A high-level inference provider entry for unified-mode synthesis.

Operators describe inference providers at this high level (backend-agnostic
vocabulary) instead of authoring raw OGX provider blocks. The
synthesizer (`apply_high_level_inference`) expands each entry into an OGX
`providers.inference` entry, mapping `type` to a `provider_type` and
emitting `${env.<VAR>}` references for secrets (never literal values).

Attributes:
    type: Canonical provider identifier. Vendor-neutral so it survives a
        future backend change; each backend-specific synthesizer maps it to
        its own provider vocabulary.
    id: Optional identifier emitted as the OGX provider_id. When
        omitted, synthesized as type with underscores hyphenated. If set,
        must be non-empty after stripping whitespace and may contain only
        lowercase letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens.
    api_key_env: Name of the environment variable holding the provider API
        key. Emitted verbatim as `${env.<name>}` so the secret never lands
        on disk resolved.
    allowed_models: Optional allow-list of model identifiers passed through
        to the synthesized provider config.
    extra: Additional provider-config keys merged verbatim into the
        synthesized provider's `config` block — an escape hatch for
        provider-specific knobs not modeled here.


| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| type | string | Canonical, backend-agnostic provider identifier mapped to an OGX provider_type by the synthesizer. |
| id | string | Optional identifier emitted as the OGX provider_id. When omitted, synthesized as type with underscores hyphenated. If set, must be non-empty after stripping whitespace and may contain only lowercase letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens. |
| api_key_env | string | Name of the environment variable holding the provider API key. Emitted as a ${env.<name>} reference so the secret is never written to disk in resolved form. |
| allowed_models | array | Optional allow-list of model identifiers for this provider. |
| extra | object | Additional provider-config keys merged verbatim into the synthesized provider's config block. |


## UnifiedOgxConfig


Backend-specific knobs for unified-mode OGX synthesis.

Per Decision S5 of the design spike, backend-agnostic high-level sections
(inference, ...) live at the configuration root, not here. This block holds
only the OGX-specific synthesis controls: which baseline to start
from, an optional profile file, and a raw native_override escape hatch.

Attributes:
    baseline: Synthesis starting point. "default" begins from LCORE's
        built-in baseline (src/data/default_run.yaml) including the
        conditional OpenAI inference provider. "byo-llm" begins from the
        same file with that OpenAI row removed. "empty" begins from an
        empty dict (used by the migration tool for an exact round-trip).
        Ignored when `profile` is set.
    profile: Optional path to a user-authored run.yaml-shaped file used as
        the synthesis baseline. Relative paths resolve against the directory
        of the loaded lightspeed-stack.yaml.
    native_override: Raw OGX schema deep-merged last (maps merge
        recursively, lists and scalars replace). The escape hatch for
        anything the high-level sections do not express.


| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| baseline | string | Synthesis starting point: 'default' uses LCORE's built-in baseline including the conditional OpenAI provider, 'byo-llm' uses the same baseline without that OpenAI row, 'empty' starts from {}. Ignored when 'profile' is set. |
| profile | string | Path to a run.yaml-shaped baseline file. Relative paths resolve against the directory of the loaded lightspeed-stack.yaml. |
| native_override | object | Raw OGX schema deep-merged last (maps merge recursively; lists and scalars replace). |

        synthesized OGX config. Required when providers is
        non-empty; must match one of providers[].id. Must be omitted when
        providers is empty.

        POST /v1/vector-stores creates. Not the same as rag.byok.stores (static
        registered corpora).
