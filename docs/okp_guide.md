# OKP Deployment and Configuration Guide

This document explains how to deploy the Offline Knowledge Portal (OKP) as a RAG source and configure Lightspeed Stack and Llama Stack to use it. You will:

* Deploy and verify the OKP Solr service
* Configure Lightspeed Stack for OKP (inline or tool RAG)
* Install dependencies and launch Lightspeed Stack
* Confirm the end-to-end stack with a sample query

For general RAG concepts, BYOK vector stores, and manual Llama Stack configuration, see the [RAG Configuration Guide](rag_guide.md).

## Introduction

OKP (Offline Knowledge Portal) provides a Solr-backed RAG source that Lightspeed Stack can use for both **Inline RAG** (context injected before the LLM request) and **Tool RAG** (context retrieved on demand via the `file_search` tool). This guide walks through deploying the OKP container, enriching your Llama Stack config from Lightspeed Stack settings, and validating that queries return referenced chunks.

---

## Prerequisites

* [lightspeed-stack repository](https://github.com/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack) cloned
* [lightspeed-providers repository](https://github.com/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-providers) cloned
* [Podman](https://podman.io/) (or Docker) to run the OKP image
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python dependency management
* An OpenAI API key (for inference when using OpenAI in your run config)

---

## Step 1: Launch OKP

> **Warning:** The image referenced below is a **prototype**. The official OKP RAG image is expected in **late March / early April** of 2026.

Start the OKP RAG service with Podman:

```bash
podman run --rm -d -p 8983:8080 images.paas.redhat.com/offline-kbase/rhokp-rag:mar-9-2026
```

> **Note:** Remove `-d` to run in the foreground.

* The service listens on **port 8983** on the host (mapped from 8080 in the container).
* Confirm it is running by opening in a browser or with `curl`:

  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost:8983
  ```

  Or visit: **http://localhost:8983**

> **Note:** Lightspeed stack will automatically enrich the llamastack configuration to add the necessary providers/resources for referencing OKP.  This assumes your OKP instance is running on localhost:8983.  If you need a different OKP url, you can set the SOLR_URL environment variable with the correct url prior to launching Lightspeed stack and that value will be used instead.
---

## Step 2: Setup llamastack config environment variables

Set the required environment variables. The external providers path must point to the `external_providers` content inside the [lightspeed-providers](https://github.com/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-providers/tree/main/lightspeed_stack_providers/) repository:

```bash
export EXTERNAL_PROVIDERS_DIR=../lightspeed-providers/resources/external_providers
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```

Adjust `EXTERNAL_PROVIDERS_DIR` if your lightspeed-providers repo is in a different location relative to your lightspeed-stack directory.

---

## Step 3: Install Lightspeed Stack Dependencies

Then install dependencies and custom providers:

```bash
uv sync --group dev --group llslibdev
uv pip install -e ../lightspeed-providers # Path to lightspeed-providers repo
```

* **`uv sync`**: Installs project and dev/llslibdev groups so that the app and tooling run correctly.
* **`uv pip install -e ../lightspeed-providers`**: Installs the lightspeed stack providers from the local clone of the repository.  Adjust the directory path as needed.

> **Note:** Running `uv sync` will remove the lightspeed-providers dependency installed by the `uv pip install` command, so you will need to rerun the `uv pip install` command if you rerun `uv sync`.

---

## Step 4: Configure Lightspeed Stack

### Enable OKP in Lightspeed Stack
Edit your Lightspeed Stack config file (e.g. `lightspeed-stack.yaml`) and add the following top-level sections so that OKP is used for either inline or tool RAG:

Inline RAG:
```yaml
# RAG configuration
rag:
  inline:
  - okp
okp:
  offline: true
```

Tool RAG:
```yaml
# RAG configuration
rag:
  tool:
  - okp
okp:
  offline: true
```

* **`rag.inline`** and **`rag.tool`**: Enable OKP as the RAG source for inline context injection and for the RAG tool.  Tool rag means the LLM will be provided a search tool it can choose to invoke to find relevant content and augment the user prompt.  The tool may or may not be invoked.  Inline means a rag search and prompt augmentation will always occur.
* **`okp.offline`**: When `true`, source URLs use `parent_id` (offline/Mimir-style). When `false`, use `reference_url` (online).

If you want to filter the docs to a specific product, you can include a query filter such as:

```yaml
okp:
  offline: true
  chunk_filter_query: "product:*openshift*"
```

When you launch Lightspeed stack it will augment the Llamastack run.yaml with configuration for OKP.

### Configure Lightspeed Stack for library mode

For the simplest local development, configure `lightspeed-stack.yaml` to consume Llama Stack in library mode:

```yaml
llama_stack:
  ...
  use_as_library_client: true
  library_client_config_path: run.yaml
  # Comment these lines out if present
  # url: http://lama-stack:87321
  # api_key: xyzzy
  ...
```

---

## Step 5: Launch Lightspeed Stack

Then launch Lightspeed Stack using your Lightspeed Stack config(`lightspeed-stack.yaml`) which references the provided default Llamastack config file (`run.yaml`):

```bash
make run
```

Lightspeed Stack has launched successfully and is available when you see this log output:

```log
INFO     2026-03-17 11:20:31,347 uvicorn.error:62 uncategorized: Application startup complete.
INFO     2026-03-17 11:20:31,349 uvicorn.error:224 uncategorized: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

---

## Step 6: Verify the Stack

Confirm that the full stack (Lightspeed Stack + Llama Stack + OKP) is working by sending a query and checking that the response includes referenced chunks from OKP:

```bash
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8080/v1/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "configure remote desktop using gnome"}' | jq .
```

* Adjust the URL and port if your Lightspeed Stack API is exposed elsewhere.
* In the JSON response, look for `rag_chunks` that indicate OKP/Solr results were retrieved.

Example response excerpt:
```json
"rag_chunks": [
{
    "content": "You can connect from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux client to a remote desktop server by using the\n**Connections**\napplication. The connection depends on the remote server configuration.\n**Prerequisites**\n- Desktop sharing or remote login is enabled on the server.

    }
}
],
```

> **Note:** The first time you query the system the response may take additional time because it must first download the necessary embedding model to perform the vector search.

If you see no RAG context, verify:

1. OKP is up at http://localhost:8983
2. `lightspeed-stack.yaml` has `okp` under `rag.inline` and/or `rag.tool` as in Step 4
