## Introduction

Lightspeed Core Stack uses the **OpenAI Responses API** (`client.responses.create()`) for generating chat completions with conversation persistence. The Responses API provides:

* Automatic conversation management with `store=True`
* Multi-turn conversation support
* Tool integration (RAG, MCP, function calls)
* Shield/guardrails support

Conversations are stored in two locations:
1. **OGX database** (`openai_conversations` and `conversation_items` tables in `public` schema)
2. **Lightspeed Stack database** (`user_conversation` table in `lightspeed-stack` schema)

> [!NOTE]
> The Responses API replaced the older Agent API (`client.agents.create_turn()`) for better OpenAI compatibility and improved conversation management.

## Conversation ID Formats

### OGX Format

When OGX creates a conversation, it generates an ID in the format:

```
conv_<48-character-hex-string>
```

**Example:**
```
conv_0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e
```

This is the format used internally by OGX and must be used when calling OGX APIs.

### Normalized Format

Lightspeed Stack normalizes conversation IDs by removing the `conv_` prefix before:
* Storing in the database
* Returning to API clients
* Displaying in CLI tools

**Example normalized ID:**
```
0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e
```

This 48-character format is what users see and work with.

### ID Conversion Utilities

LCS provides utilities in `src/utils/suid.py` for ID conversion:

```python
from utils.suid import normalize_conversation_id, to_ogx_conversation_id

# Convert from OGX format to normalized format
normalized_id = normalize_conversation_id("conv_0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e")
# Returns: "0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e"

# Convert from normalized format to OGX format
ogx_id = to_ogx_conversation_id("0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e")
# Returns: "conv_0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e"
```

## How Conversations Work

### Creating New Conversations

When a user makes a query **without** providing a `conversation_id`:

1. LCS creates a new conversation using `client.conversations.create(metadata={})`
2. OGX returns a conversation ID (e.g., `conv_abc123...`)
3. LCS normalizes the ID and stores it in the database
4. The query is sent to `client.responses.create()` with the conversation ID
5. The normalized ID is returned to the client

**Code flow (from `src/app/endpoints/query_v2.py`):**

```python
# No conversation_id provided - create a new conversation first
conversation = await client.conversations.create(metadata={})
ogx_conv_id = conversation.id
# Store the normalized version
conversation_id = normalize_conversation_id(ogx_conv_id)

# Use the conversation in responses.create()
response = await client.responses.create(
    input=input_text,
    model=model_id,
    instructions=system_prompt,
    store=True,
    conversation=ogx_conv_id,  # Use OGX format
    # ... other parameters
)
```

### Continuing Existing Conversations

When a user provides an existing `conversation_id`:

1. LCS receives the normalized ID (e.g., `0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e`)
2. Converts it to OGX format (adds `conv_` prefix)
3. Sends the query to `client.responses.create()` with the existing conversation ID
4. OGX retrieves the conversation history and continues the conversation
5. The conversation history is automatically included in the LLM context

**Code flow:**

```python
# Conversation ID was provided - convert to OGX format
conversation_id = query_request.conversation_id
ogx_conv_id = to_ogx_conversation_id(conversation_id)

# Use the existing conversation
response = await client.responses.create(
    input=input_text,
    model=model_id,
    conversation=ogx_conv_id,  # Existing conversation
    # ... other parameters
)
```

### Conversation Storage

Conversations are stored in **two databases**:

#### 1. OGX Database (PostgreSQL `public` schema)

**Tables:**
- `openai_conversations`: Stores conversation metadata
- `conversation_items`: Stores individual messages/turns in conversations

**Configuration (in OGX `run.yaml` / library client config; see `examples/run.yaml`):**
```yaml
apis:
- conversations
# ...
storage:
  backends:
    sql_default:
      type: sql_sqlite
      db_path: ${env.SQL_STORE_PATH:=~/.llama/storage/sql_store.db}
  stores:
    conversations:
      table_name: openai_conversations
      backend: sql_default
```

#### 2. Lightspeed Stack Database (PostgreSQL `lightspeed-stack` schema)

**Table:** `user_conversation`

Stores user-specific metadata:
- Conversation ID (normalized, without `conv_` prefix)
- User ID
- Last used model and provider
- Creation and last message timestamps
- Message count
- Topic summary

## API Endpoints

### Query Endpoint (v2)

**Endpoint:** `POST /v2/query`

**Request:**
```json

## Testing with curl

You can test the Conversations API endpoints using `curl`. The examples below assume the server is running on `localhost:8090`.

First, set your authorization token:

```bash
export TOKEN="<your-token>"
```

### Non-Streaming Query (New Conversation)

To start a new conversation, omit the `conversation_id` field:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/v2/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What is the OpenShift Assisted Installer?",
    "model": "models/gemini-2.0-flash",
    "provider": "gemini"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e",
  "response": "The OpenShift Assisted Installer is...",
  "rag_chunks": [],
  "tool_calls": [],
  "referenced_documents": [],
  "truncated": false,
  "input_tokens": 150,
  "output_tokens": 200,
  "available_quotas": {}
}
```

### Non-Streaming Query (Continue Conversation)

To continue an existing conversation, include the `conversation_id` from a previous response:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/v2/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "conversation_id": "0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e",
    "query": "How do I install it?",
    "model": "models/gemini-2.0-flash",
    "provider": "gemini"
  }'
```

### Streaming Query (New Conversation)

For streaming responses, use the `/v2/streaming_query` endpoint. The response is returned as Server-Sent Events (SSE):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/v2/streaming_query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What is the OpenShift Assisted Installer?",
    "model": "models/gemini-2.0-flash",
    "provider": "gemini"
  }'
```

**Response (SSE stream):**
```
data: {"event": "start", "data": {"conversation_id": "0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e"}}

data: {"event": "token", "data": {"id": 0, "token": "The "}}

data: {"event": "token", "data": {"id": 1, "token": "OpenShift "}}

data: {"event": "turn_complete", "data": {"id": 10, "token": "The OpenShift Assisted Installer is..."}}

data: {"event": "end", "data": {"referenced_documents": [], "input_tokens": 150, "output_tokens": 200}}
```

### Streaming Query (Continue Conversation)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/v2/streaming_query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "conversation_id": "0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e",
    "query": "Can you explain the prerequisites?",
    "model": "models/gemini-2.0-flash",
    "provider": "gemini"
  }'
```

### List Conversations

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8090/v3/conversations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Get Conversation Details

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8090/v3/conversations/0d21ba731f21f798dc9680125d5d6f493e4a7ab79f25670e \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Database Schema

### Lightspeed Stack Schema

**Table:** `lightspeed-stack.user_conversation`

```sql
CREATE TABLE "lightspeed-stack".user_conversation (
    id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,              -- Normalized conversation ID (48 chars)
    user_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,            -- User identifier
    last_used_model VARCHAR NOT NULL,    -- Model name (e.g., "gemini-2.0-flash-exp")
    last_used_provider VARCHAR NOT NULL, -- Provider (e.g., "google")
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_message_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    message_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    topic_summary VARCHAR DEFAULT ''
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_conversation_user_id ON "lightspeed-stack".user_conversation(user_id);
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `id` column uses `VARCHAR` without a length limit, which PostgreSQL treats similarly to `TEXT`. This accommodates the 48-character normalized conversation IDs.

### OGX Schema

**Table:** `public.openai_conversations`

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.openai_conversations (
    id VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,          -- Full ID with conv_ prefix (53 chars)
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    metadata JSONB
);
```

**Table:** `public.conversation_items`

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.conversation_items (
    id VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    conversation_id VARCHAR(64) REFERENCES openai_conversations(id),
    turn_number INTEGER,
    content JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Conversation Not Found Error

**Symptom:**
```
Error: Conversation not found (HTTP 404)
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Conversation ID was truncated (should be 48 characters, not 41)
2. Conversation ID has incorrect prefix (should NOT include `conv_` when calling LCS API)
3. Conversation was deleted
4. Database connection issue

**Solution:**
- Verify the conversation ID is exactly 48 characters
- Ensure you're using the normalized ID format (without `conv_` prefix) when calling LCS endpoints
- Check database connectivity

### Model/Provider Changes Not Persisting

**Symptom:**
The `last_used_model` and `last_used_provider` fields don't update when using a different model.

**Explanation:**
This is expected behavior. The Responses API v2 allows you to change the model/provider for each query within the same conversation. The `last_used_model` field only tracks the most recently used model for display purposes in the conversation list.

### Tool `tool_calls`/`tool_results` Differ Between v1 and v2/v3 Conversation Reads

**Symptom:**
After a Granite Guardian TOOL-point guardrail blocks a tool result (see
[Safety Shields Guide](../user_doc/shields_guide.md)), `GET
/v1/conversations/{conversation_id}` shows the tool call *and* its real
(flagged) result content, while the live query response and the LCORE
conversation cache (used by `/v2` and `/v3` conversation reads) correctly
show the call with the result withheld.

**Explanation:**
This is expected, not a bug — the two reads have different sources of truth:

- The live response and LCORE's own conversation cache are built from the
  in-memory `AgentRunResult` that the Granite Guardian capability rewrites on
  a TOOL-point violation (see
  `pydantic_ai_lightspeed.capabilities.granite_guardian._capability`): the
  offending tool call is kept, but its result — and every later tool
  result in that same turn — is replaced with a content-stripped,
  `outcome="denied"` placeholder before it's ever cached or returned.
- `GET /v1/conversations/{conversation_id}` instead reads OGX's own
  Conversations API item history (`conversation_items` table) directly.
  When a `conversation` ID is attached to the model request, **OGX persists
  each tool-call item itself, server-side, as part of the model call** —
  before the Granite Guardian capability ever gets a chance to screen the
  result. By the time a TOOL-point violation is caught, that item is already
  durably stored with its real content.

  LCORE does patch OGX's copy of the *final assistant message* on a
  violation (`replace_last_assistant_message` in `src/utils/conversations.py`,
  used from `_reject`), since it's always the very last item and OGX's Items
  API only supports `create`/`delete`/`get`/`list` (no in-place update, and
  `create` always appends at the end). Applying the same redaction to an
  earlier tool-call item would mean deleting and recreating every item from
  that point onward — including the trailing assistant message — which risks
  reordering or racing with anything else OGX appends to the conversation
  concurrently. That trade-off hasn't been made, so v1's raw item history
  currently reflects OGX's original, unredacted record for tool activity.

**Takeaway:** Treat the LCORE conversation cache (`/v2`/`/v3` conversation
reads, and the live query/response body) as the guardrail-authoritative view
of `tool_calls`/`tool_results`. `GET /v1/conversations/{conversation_id}`
reflects OGX's raw, unredacted item history and may still show content that
a TOOL-point risk flagged.

### Empty Conversation History

**Symptom:**
Calling `/v3/conversations/{conversation_id}` returns empty `chat_history`.

**Possible Causes:**
1. The conversation was just created and has no messages yet
2. The conversation exists in Lightspeed DB but not in OGX DB (data inconsistency)
3. Database connection to OGX is failing

**Solution:**
- Verify the conversation has messages by checking `message_count`
- Check OGX database connectivity
- Verify `openai_conversations` and `conversation_items` tables exist and are accessible
