## A2AStateConfiguration


A2A protocol persistent state configuration.

Configures how A2A task state and context-to-conversation mappings are
stored. For multi-worker deployments, use SQLite or PostgreSQL to ensure
state is shared across all workers.

If no configuration is provided, in-memory storage is used (default).
This is suitable for single-worker deployments but state will be lost
on restarts and not shared across workers.

Attributes:
    sqlite: SQLite database configuration for A2A state storage.
    postgres: PostgreSQL database configuration for A2A state storage.

## CORSConfiguration


CORS configuration.

CORS or 'Cross-Origin Resource Sharing' refers to the situations when a
frontend running in a browser has JavaScript code that communicates with a
backend, and the backend is in a different 'origin' than the frontend.

## CompactionConfiguration


Configuration for conversation history compaction.

Compaction summarizes older conversation turns when their estimated
token count approaches the context window limit, keeping the
conversation usable instead of failing with HTTP 413. The
configuration here controls when compaction triggers and how much
recent context is preserved verbatim.

Attributes:
    enabled: Master switch. When False, compaction never triggers
        and other fields are inert.
    threshold_ratio: Trigger compaction when estimated input tokens
        exceed this fraction of the model's context window
        (clamped to 0.0..1.0).
    token_floor: Minimum estimated token count before compaction
        can trigger, regardless of threshold_ratio. Prevents
        triggering on very small context windows.
    buffer_turns: Initial number of recent turns to keep verbatim.
        The runtime applies a degrading guard — if these turns
        exceed the available budget, it reduces buffer_turns by
        one repeatedly until the budget fits, down to zero.
    buffer_max_ratio: Hard cap on the fraction of the context
        window the buffer zone may occupy, regardless of
        buffer_turns.


| Field            | Type    | Description                                                                                                 |
|------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| enabled          | boolean | When true, older conversation turns are summarized when estimated tokens approach the context window limit. |
| threshold_ratio  | number  | Trigger compaction when estimated tokens exceed this fraction of the model's context window (0.0-1.0).      |
| token_floor      | integer | Minimum token count before compaction can trigger. Prevents triggering on very small context windows.       |
| buffer_turns     | integer | Number of recent turns to keep verbatim.                                                                    |
| buffer_max_ratio | number  | Maximum fraction of context window the buffer zone can occupy, regardless of buffer_turns.                  |

### How to enable conversation compaction

Compaction is disabled by default. To enable it, add a `compaction` section to your `lightspeed-stack.yaml` and set `enabled: true`. You must also register context window sizes for the models you use via the `inference.context_windows` map so the compaction trigger can calculate when older turns should be summarized.

**Minimal configuration:**

```yaml
inference:
  default_provider: openai
  default_model: gpt-4o-mini
  context_windows:
    openai/gpt-4o-mini: 128000

compaction:
  enabled: true
```

**Full configuration with all options:**

```yaml
inference:
  default_provider: openai
  default_model: gpt-4o-mini
  context_windows:
    openai/gpt-4o-mini: 128000
    openai/gpt-4o: 128000

compaction:
  enabled: true
  threshold_ratio: 0.7       # trigger at 70% of context window (default)
  token_floor: 4096           # minimum tokens before compaction can fire (default)
  buffer_turns: 4             # recent turns kept verbatim (default)
  buffer_max_ratio: 0.3       # buffer may use at most 30% of the window (default)
```

**Key considerations:**

- `context_windows` is required. Models absent from this map have no registered window and compaction will not trigger for them.
- `threshold_ratio` controls how aggressively compaction fires. Lower values compact sooner; higher values wait longer (closer to the window limit).
- `buffer_turns` sets how many recent user/assistant turn pairs are kept in full. A degrading guard automatically reduces this if the buffer itself would exceed `buffer_max_ratio` of the window.
- `token_floor` prevents compaction from triggering on very short conversations.
- When compaction is disabled (the default), requests that exceed the context window surface as HTTP 413.

| context_windows  | object  | Map of fully-qualified model identifier (e.g., "openai/gpt-4o-mini") to context window size in tokens. Used by the conversation compaction trigger to decide when older turns must be summarized before the input exceeds the window. Models absent from this map have no registered window — callers fall back to their own default or skip the token-based trigger.                                                                                    |
| providers        | array   | Unified-mode synthesis input (Decision S5): a high-level, backend-agnostic list of inference providers the synthesizer expands into OGX provider entries. Lives at the configuration root so it survives a future backend change. A non-empty list signals unified mode. Empty (the default) leaves legacy/remote modes unaffected. The sibling default_model / default_provider keep their query-time routing meaning and are independent of this list. |
| max_infer_iters  | integer | Server-side default for the maximum number of inference iterations a model can perform in a single request. Prevents small models from looping indefinitely on tool calls. Per-request values take precedence over this default. Set to None to disable the limit.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| max_tool_calls   | integer | Server-side default for the maximum number of tool calls allowed in a single response. Prevents small models from exhausting the context window with repeated tool calls. Per-request values take precedence over this default. Set to None to disable the limit.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## JwtConfiguration


JWT (JSON Web Token) configuration.

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing
claims to be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a JWT
are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON
Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web
Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally
signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code
(MAC) and/or encrypted.

## ModelContextProtocolServer


Model context protocol server configuration.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide tools and capabilities to the
AI agents. These are configured by this structure. Only MCP servers
defined in the lightspeed-stack.yaml configuration are available to the
agents. Tools configured in the OGX run.yaml are not accessible to

| authorization_headers | object  | Headers to send to the MCP server. The map contains the header name and the path to a file containing the header value (secret). There are 3 special cases: 1. Usage of the kubernetes token in the header. To specify this use a string 'kubernetes' instead of the file path. 2. Usage of the client-provided token in the header. To specify this use a string 'client' instead of the file path. 3. Usage of the oauth token in the header. To specify this use a string 'oauth' instead of the file path. |
| headers               | array   | List of HTTP header names to automatically forward from the incoming request to this MCP server. Headers listed here are extracted from the original client request and included when calling the MCP server. This is useful when infrastructure components (e.g. API gateways) inject headers that MCP servers need, such as x-rh-identity in HCC. Header matching is case-insensitive. These headers are additive with authorization_headers and MCP-HEADERS.                                                |
| require_approval      |         | When to require human approval for tool invocations. 'always' requires approval for all tools, 'never' auto-approves, or use ApprovalFilter for granular control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| timeout               | integer | Timeout in seconds for requests to the MCP server. If not specified, the default timeout from OGX will be used. Note: This field is reserved for future use when OGX adds timeout support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| config                     |         | Backend-specific knobs for unified mode, where LCORE synthesizes the OGX run.yaml instead of reading an external file. Holds the baseline selector, an optional profile path, and a raw native_override escape hatch. Backend-agnostic high-level sections (e.g. inference.providers) live at the configuration root, not here. Mutually exclusive with library_client_config_path; that cross-field check lives on the root Configuration model. When set in library mode, library_client_config_path is not required. |

## QuotaHandlersConfiguration


Quota limiter configuration.

It is possible to limit quota usage per user or per service or services
(that typically run in one cluster). Each limit is configured as a separate
_quota limiter_. It can be of type `user_limiter` or `cluster_limiter`
(which is name that makes sense in OpenShift deployment).


| Field                | Type    | Description                                           |

| enable_token_history | boolean | Enables storing information about token usage history |


## QuotaLimiterConfiguration


Configuration for one quota limiter.

There are three configuration options for each limiter:

1. ``period`` is specified in a human-readable form, see
   https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-INTERVAL-INPUT
   for all possible options. When the end of the period is reached, the
   quota is reset or increased.
2. ``initial_quota`` is the value set at the beginning of the period.
3. ``quota_increase`` is the value (if specified) used to increase the
   quota when the period is reached.

There are two basic use cases:

1. When the quota needs to be reset to a specific value periodically (for
   example on a weekly or monthly basis), set ``initial_quota`` to the
   required value.
2. When the quota needs to be increased by a specific value periodically
   (for example on a daily basis), set ``quota_increase``.

        name="liability",
        description="Content requesting legal, medical, or financial advice",
        threshold=0.55,
        points=["input"],

        description="User is asking the AI to reveal personal information",
        threshold=0.50,
        points=["input", "tool"],
    )
Note:
    To enable think mode (detailed reasoning) for a risk, add the risk name
    to the `thinking_enabled` list in `ModerationConfig`. Do not set
    `enable_thinking` directly - it is managed internally.

| max_concurrent_file_uploads           | integer | Maximum number of file uploads (POST /v1/files) processed concurrently per worker. Each in-flight upload can hold up to the configured maximum file size in memory, so this bounds worst-case memory usage from concurrent uploads. Additional uploads are rejected with 429 until a slot frees up.                                                                                                                                                                            |

Each in-flight attachment re-reads and chunks the source file, so this bounds worst-case memory usage independently of max_concurrent_file_uploads. Additional attachments are rejected with 429 until a slot frees up.                                                                                                                                 |
| delete_file_after_vector_store_attach | boolean | When true, deletes a file (POST /v1/files) once it has been successfully attached to a vector store, since the vector store keeps its own chunked/embedded copy of the content. Defaults to false to match the OpenAI Files API, where a file remains reusable across multiple vector stores until the caller explicitly deletes it - enabling this makes attached files single-use: re-attaching the same file_id to another vector store will fail once it has been deleted. |

## SkillsConfiguration


Agent skills configuration.

Specifies paths to skill directories. Skill metadata (name, description)
is read from SKILL.md frontmatter at startup.

Each path can point to either:
- A directory containing a SKILL.md file (single skill)
- A directory containing subdirectories with SKILL.md files (multiple skills)

Paths are validated at startup to ensure they exist and contain valid SKILL.md files.


| Field | Type  | Description                                                                |

## TLSConfiguration


TLS configuration.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to
provide communications security over a computer network, such as the
Internet. The protocol is widely used in applications such as email,
instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use in securing HTTPS remains
the most publicly visible.

| allowed_service_accounts | array  | Optional allowlist of Kubernetes ServiceAccount identities permitted to act as trusted proxies. When set to null/omitted, any ServiceAccount with a valid token is accepted. When set to a non-empty list, only the listed ServiceAccounts are allowed. An empty list behaves the same as null (no restriction). |


## TrustedProxyServiceAccount


A Kubernetes ServiceAccount identity for trusted-proxy allowlist.

## UnifiedInferenceProvider


A high-level inference provider entry for unified-mode synthesis.

Operators describe inference providers at this high level (backend-agnostic
vocabulary) instead of authoring raw OGX provider blocks. The
synthesizer (`apply_high_level_inference`) expands each entry into an OGX
`providers.inference` entry, mapping `type` to a `provider_type` and
emitting `${env.<VAR>}` references for secrets (never literal values).

Attributes:
    type: Canonical provider identifier. Vendor-neutral so it survives a
        future backend change; each backend-specific synthesizer maps it to
        its own provider vocabulary.
    id: Optional identifier emitted as the OGX provider_id. When
        omitted, synthesized as type with underscores hyphenated. If set,
        must be non-empty after stripping whitespace and may contain only
        lowercase letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens.
    api_key_env: Name of the environment variable holding the provider API
        key. Emitted verbatim as `${env.<name>}` so the secret never lands
        on disk resolved.
    allowed_models: Optional allow-list of model identifiers passed through
        to the synthesized provider config.
    extra: Additional provider-config keys merged verbatim into the
        synthesized provider's `config` block — an escape hatch for
        provider-specific knobs not modeled here.

|----------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type           | string | Canonical, backend-agnostic provider identifier mapped to an OGX provider_type by the synthesizer.                                                                                                                                                |
| id             | string | Optional identifier emitted as the OGX provider_id. When omitted, synthesized as type with underscores hyphenated. If set, must be non-empty after stripping whitespace and may contain only lowercase letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens. |
| api_key_env    | string | Name of the environment variable holding the provider API key. Emitted as a ${env.<name>} reference so the secret is never written to disk in resolved form.                                                                                      |

| extra          | object | Additional provider-config keys merged verbatim into the synthesized provider's config block.                                                                                                                                                     |


## UnifiedOgxConfig


Backend-specific knobs for unified-mode OGX synthesis.

Per Decision S5 of the design spike, backend-agnostic high-level sections
(inference, ...) live at the configuration root, not here. This block holds
only the OGX-specific synthesis controls: which baseline to start
from, an optional profile file, and a raw native_override escape hatch.

Attributes:
    baseline: Synthesis starting point. "default" begins from LCORE's
        built-in baseline (src/data/default_run.yaml) including the
        conditional OpenAI inference provider. "byo-llm" begins from the
        same file with that OpenAI row removed. "empty" begins from an
        empty dict (used by the migration tool for an exact round-trip).
        Ignored when `profile` is set.
    profile: Optional path to a user-authored run.yaml-shaped file used as
        the synthesis baseline. Relative paths resolve against the directory
        of the loaded lightspeed-stack.yaml.
    native_override: Raw OGX schema deep-merged last (maps merge
        recursively, lists and scalars replace). The escape hatch for
        anything the high-level sections do not express.


| Field           | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| baseline        | string | Synthesis starting point: 'default' uses LCORE's built-in baseline including the conditional OpenAI provider, 'byo-llm' uses the same baseline without that OpenAI row, 'empty' starts from {}. Ignored when 'profile' is set. |
| profile         | string | Path to a run.yaml-shaped baseline file. Relative paths resolve against the directory of the loaded lightspeed-stack.yaml.                                                                                                     |
| native_override | object | Raw OGX schema deep-merged last (maps merge recursively; lists and scalars replace).                                                                                                                                           |


## UserDataCollection


User data collection configuration.


| Field               | Type    | Description                                                                        |
|---------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| feedback_enabled    | boolean | When set to true the user feedback is stored and later sent for analysis.          |
| feedback_storage    | string  | Path to directory where feedback will be saved for further processing.             |
| transcripts_enabled | boolean | When set to true the conversation history is stored and later sent for analysis.   |
| transcripts_storage | string  | Path to directory where conversation history will be saved for further processing. |


## VectorStoreConfiguration


Configuration for dynamic vector-store providers.

Mirrors ``InferenceConfiguration``: a providers list plus a sibling
``default_provider`` pointer, rather than a per-entry default flag.

Attributes:
    default_provider: Provider id used for vector_stores.default_* in the
        synthesized OGX config. Required when providers is
        non-empty; must match one of providers[].id. Must be omitted when
        providers is empty.
    providers: Dynamic vector-store provider capacity for runtime
        POST /v1/vector-stores creates. Not the same as rag.byok.stores (static
        registered corpora).


| Field            | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| default_provider | string | Provider id used for vector_stores.default_* in the synthesized OGX config. Required when providers is non-empty; must match one of providers[].id. |
| providers        | array  | Dynamic vector-store provider capacity for runtime POST /v1/vector-stores creates. Not the same as rag.byok.stores (static registered corpora).     |
