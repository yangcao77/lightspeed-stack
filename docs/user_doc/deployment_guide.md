## Preface

In this document, you will learn how to install and run a service called *Lightspeed Core Stack (LCS)*. It is a service that allows users to communicate with large language models (LLMs), access to RAG databases, call so called agents, process conversation history, ensure that the conversation is only about permitted topics, etc.



## Deployment methods

*Lightspeed Core Stack (LCS)* is built on the OGX framework, which can be run in several modes. Additionally, it is possible to run *LCS* locally (as a regular Python application) or from within a container. This means that it is possible to leverage multiple deployment methods:

- Local deployment
    - OGX framework is used as a library
    - OGX framework is used as a separate process (deployed locally)
- Running from a container
    - OGX framework is used as a library
    - OGX framework is used as a separate process

All those deployments methods will be covered later.



## Configuration modes

*LCS* reads one operator-facing file: `lightspeed-stack.yaml`. There are two
ways it can drive the underlying OGX:

1. **Unified mode (recommended).** The single `lightspeed-stack.yaml` is the
   only configuration file you maintain. LCORE *synthesizes* the OGX
   `run.yaml` from it at startup — from a built-in default baseline, an
   optional [profile](#profiles) you author, the high-level
   `inference.providers` section, and a raw `native_override` escape hatch.
   All examples in this guide show unified mode first.
2. **Legacy two-file mode (deprecated).** `ogx.library_client_config_path`
   (the deprecated `llama_stack` YAML-section alias is still accepted)
   points at an external, hand-maintained `run.yaml`. This path is deprecated:
   since release 0.6 it logs a startup warning, and it is **removed in
   release 0.8**. See
   [Migrating from the legacy two-file configuration](#migrating-from-the-legacy-two-file-configuration).

> [!NOTE]
> The deprecated `llama_stack` YAML key remains accepted with a startup
> warning; use `ogx:` for new configuration. See
> [Migrating from the legacy two-file configuration](#migrating-from-the-legacy-two-file-configuration)
> and [v0.7.0 migration notes](../migrations/v0.7.0.md).

The two modes are mutually exclusive in one file — configuration loading
fails if a unified synthesis input and `library_client_config_path` are both
present.



## Integration with OGX framework

The OGX framework can be run as a standalone server and accessed via its the REST API. However, instead of direct communication via the REST API (and JSON format), there is an even better alternative. It is based on the so-called OGX Client. It is a library available for Python, Swift, Node.js or Kotlin, which "wraps" the REST API stack in a suitable way, which is easier for many applications.



### OGX as a library

When this mode is selected, OGX is used as a regular Python library. This means that the library must be installed in the system Python environment, a user-level environment, or a virtual environment. All calls to OGX are performed via standard function or method calls:

![OGX as library](./ogx_as_library.svg)

> [!NOTE]
> Even when OGX is used as a library, it still requires a `run.yaml`
> configuration during the initialization phase. In unified mode (the
> recommended default) LCORE synthesizes that file for you from
> `lightspeed-stack.yaml`; only the deprecated legacy mode requires you to
> maintain `run.yaml` by hand.



### Profiles

In unified mode (where LCORE synthesizes the OGX `run.yaml` from
`lightspeed-stack.yaml` instead of reading an external file), the synthesis
starts from a *baseline*. By default that is LCORE's built-in baseline; a
**profile** replaces it with a file you author.

A profile is an ordinary `run.yaml`-shaped YAML file — the same schema OGX reads natively. Everything else in the unified pipeline (enrichment,
the high-level `inference.providers` section, ensuring the MCP tool_runtime
provider, then `native_override`) is applied *on top* of the profile, in that
order. The MCP ensure adds `provider_id: model-context-protocol` when missing
so static `mcp_servers` and dynamic MCP registration work; it is skipped only
for `baseline: empty` (use `native_override` there if you need MCP).

**Authoring a profile.** Start from one of the reference profiles shipped in
[`examples/profiles/`](https://github.com/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack/tree/main/examples/profiles):

- `openai-remote.yaml` — remote OpenAI inference plus inline
  sentence-transformers embeddings and FAISS; boots with only
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` set.
- `inline-faiss.yaml` — fully inline (sentence-transformers + FAISS), no
  remote provider and no API key; pair it with a chat provider via the
  high-level `inference.providers` section.

Keep secrets out of the file: write `${env.MY_KEY}` environment references,
which OGX resolves at startup.

**Referencing a profile.** Point `ogx.config.profile` at the file:

```yaml
name: Lightspeed Core Service (LCS)
service:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8080
ogx:
  use_as_library_client: true
  config:
    profile: ./profiles/openai-remote.yaml
```

A relative `profile:` path resolves against the directory of the loaded
`lightspeed-stack.yaml` (not the current working directory); absolute paths
are used as-is. When `profile` is set, the `baseline` selector is ignored,
and `library_client_config_path` must not be set (unified and legacy inputs
are mutually exclusive).

The reference profiles are sanity-checked by the unit suite
(`tests/unit/test_ogx_synthesize.py`), so they stay loadable as the
synthesizer evolves.



### High-level inference providers

LLM providers can be declared directly in `lightspeed-stack.yaml`, in the
top-level `inference.providers` section, without writing any OGX
configuration:

```yaml
ogx:
  use_as_library_client: true
  config:
    baseline: byo-llm
inference:
  default_provider: openai
  default_model: gpt-4o-mini
  providers:
    - type: openai
      api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
      allowed_models:
        - gpt-4o-mini
```

`api_key_env` names the environment variable that holds the key. The
synthesized configuration contains only a `${env.OPENAI_API_KEY}` reference;
the value is never written to disk. A complete file is in
[examples/lightspeed-stack-unified-byo-llm.yaml](../../examples/lightspeed-stack-unified-byo-llm.yaml).

`ogx.config.baseline` selects the starting point of the synthesis:

| Baseline | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `byo-llm` | The built-in baseline without any LLM provider. Declare yours under `inference.providers`. Recommended. |
| `default` | The built-in baseline including a built-in OpenAI provider that is enabled when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set. |
| `empty` | Starts from an empty configuration. Used by `--migrate-config`. |

> [!WARNING]
> The built-in OpenAI provider in `baseline: default` is deprecated in
> release 0.7 (a startup warning is logged) and will be removed in release
> 0.8. Set `baseline: byo-llm` and declare your LLM providers under
> `inference.providers`.

### OGX as a server

When this mode is selected, OGX is started as a separate REST API service. All communication with OGX is performed via REST API calls, which means that OGX can run on a separate machine if needed.

![OGX as service](./ogx_as_service.svg)

> [!NOTE]
> The REST API schema and semantics can change at any time, especially before version 1.0.0 is released. By using *Lightspeed Core Service*, developers, users, and customers stay isolated from these incompatibilities.



## Migrating from the legacy two-file configuration

Three migration paths, per deployment:

| Path | Effort | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Do nothing | none | Legacy keeps working until removal in 0.8 (with a startup deprecation warning) |
| Lift-and-shift | seconds — `--migrate-config` | Single file, byte-equivalent OGX behavior |
| Re-express | hours+ | Single file; high-level sections and/or a profile replace the lifted `run.yaml` |

### Step-by-step: lift-and-shift with `--migrate-config`

Given a legacy pair — a hand-maintained `run.yaml` plus a
`lightspeed-stack.yaml` that points at it:

```yaml
# lightspeed-stack.yaml (legacy, deprecated)
name: LCS
llama_stack:
  use_as_library_client: true
  library_client_config_path: ./run.yaml
# ... rest ...
```

1. Run the migration tool:

   ```bash
   lightspeed-stack --migrate-config \
     --run-yaml run.yaml \
     -c lightspeed-stack.yaml \
     --migrate-output lightspeed-stack-unified.yaml
   ```

2. Inspect the output. Everything from your `lightspeed-stack.yaml` is
   preserved; only the `llama_stack` section changes —
   `library_client_config_path` is removed and your entire `run.yaml` is
   lifted into the unified config block:

   ```yaml
   # lightspeed-stack-unified.yaml
   name: LCS
   ogx:
     use_as_library_client: true
     config:
       baseline: empty
       native_override:
         # ... your run.yaml content, verbatim ...
   ```

3. Replace literal secrets. If your `run.yaml` contained secret values
   directly, replace them with `${env.MY_VAR}` environment references —
   the migrated file otherwise carries them onto disk verbatim (the
   synthesized output is written owner-only, mode 0600, as a safety net).

4. Swap the file in (`mv lightspeed-stack-unified.yaml
   lightspeed-stack.yaml`), delete the now-unused external `run.yaml`
   mount/copy, and restart. OGX behavior is identical: synthesis
   starts from an empty baseline and deep-merges only your lifted
   `run.yaml`.

Later, at your own pace, you can slim the `native_override` down by moving
providers into the high-level `inference.providers` section or into a
[profile](#profiles) — that is the "re-express" path.

### Deprecation schedule

Unified mode shipped in release 0.6 with legacy mode fully functional plus
a startup deprecation warning; the legacy two-file path is removed in
release 0.8.



## Local deployment

In this chapter it will be shown how to run LCS locally. This mode is especially useful for developers, as it is possible to work with the latest versions of source codes, including locally made changes and improvements. And last but not least, it is possible to trace, monitor and debug the entire system from within integrated development environment etc.



### OGX used as a separate process

The easiest option is to run OGX in a separate process. This means that there will at least be two running processes involved:

1. OGX framework with open port 8321 (can be easily changed if needed)
1. LCS with open port 8080 (can be easily changed if needed)



#### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.12 or 3.13
1. `pip` tool installed
1. `jq` and `curl` tools installed

#### Installation of all required tools

1. `pip install --user uv`
1. `sudo dnf install curl jq`

#### Installing dependencies for OGX


1. Create a new directory outside of the lightspeed-stack project directory
    ```bash
    mkdir /tmp/ogx-server
    ```
1. Copy the project file named `pyproject.ogx.toml` into the new directory, renaming it to `pyproject.toml`:
    ```bash
    cp examples/pyproject.ogx.toml /tmp/ogx-server/pyproject.toml
    ```

1. Run the following command to install all OGX dependencies in a new venv located in your new directory:

    ```bash
    cd /tmp/ogx-server
    uv sync
    ```

    You should get the following output:

    ```ascii

     + yarl==1.20.1
     + zipp==3.23.0
    ```



#### Check if OGX can be started

1. In the next step, we need to verify that it is possible to run a tool called `ogx`. It was installed into a Python virtual environment and therefore we have to run it via `uv run` command:
    ```bash
     uv run ogx
    ```
1. If the installation was successful, the following messages should be displayed on the terminal:
    ```
    usage: ogx [-h] {model,stack,download,verify-download} ...

    Welcome to the OGX CLI

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    subcommands:
      {model,stack,download,verify-download}

      model                 Work with llama models
      stack                 Operations for the OGX / Distributions
      download              Download a model from llama.meta.com or Hugging Face Hub
      verify-download       Verify integrity of downloaded model files
    ```
1. If we try to run the OGX without configuring it, only the exception information is displayed (which is not very user-friendly):
    ```bash
    uv run ogx stack run
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    INFO     2025-07-27 16:56:12,464 llama_stack.cli.stack.run:147 server: No image type or image name provided. Assuming environment packages.

        elif args.template:
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    AttributeError: 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'template'
    ```



#### OGX configuration

OGX needs to be configured properly. For using the default runnable OGX a file named `run.yaml` needs to be created.  Copy the example `examples/run.yaml` from the lightspeed-stack project directory into your OGX directory.

```bash
cp examples/run.yaml /tmp/ogx-server
```


#### Run OGX in a separate process

1. Export OpenAI key by using the following command:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-foo-bar-baz"
    ```
1. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    uv run ogx stack run run.yaml
    ```
1. Check the output on terminal, it should look like:
    ```

1. The server with OGX listens on port 8321. A description of the REST API is available in the form of OpenAPI (endpoint /openapi.json), but other endpoints can also be used. It is possible to check if OGX runs as REST API server by retrieving its version. We use `curl` and `jq` tools for this purposes:
    ```bash
    curl localhost:8321/v1/version | jq .
    ```
    The output should be in this form:
    ```json
    {
      "version": "0.2.22"
    }
    ```


#### LCS configuration to connect to OGX running in separate process

Copy the `examples/lightspeed-stack-lls-external.yaml` file to your OGX project directory, naming it `lightspeed-stack.yaml`:

```bash
cp examples/lightspeed-stack-lls-external.yaml lightspeed-stack.yaml`
```


#### Start LCS

```bash
make run
```

```

### OGX used as a library

It is possible to run Lightspeed Core Stack service with OGX "embedded" as a Python library. This means that just one process will be running and only one port (for example 8080) will be accessible.




#### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.12 or 3.13
1. `pip` tool installed
1. `jq` and `curl` tools installed

#### Installation of all required tools

1. `pip install --user uv`
1. `sudo dnf install curl jq`

#### Installing dependencies for OGX

1. Clone LCS repository
1. Add and install all required dependencies
    ```bash
    uv sync --group ogxlibdev
    ```

#### OGX configuration

OGX needs to be configured properly. Copy the example config from examples/run.yaml to the project directory:

```bash
cp examples/run.yaml .
```


#### LCS configuration to use OGX in library mode
Copy the example LCS config file from examples/lightspeed-stack-lls-library.yaml to the project directory:

```bash
cp examples/lightspeed-stack-lls-library.yaml lightspeed-stack.yaml
```

The example is a unified-mode configuration: the `run.yaml` you created above
is consumed as the synthesis [profile](#profiles) via
`ogx.config.profile` — there is no deprecated
`library_client_config_path` in it.


#### Start LCS

1. Export OpenAI key by using the following command:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-foo-bar-baz"
    ```
1. Run the following command
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
1. Check the output

#### Check if service runs

```bash
curl localhost:8080/v1/models | jq .
```

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "identifier": "gpt-4-turbo",
      "metadata": {},
      "api_model_type": "llm",
      "provider_id": "openai",
      "type": "model",
      "provider_resource_id": "gpt-4-turbo",
      "model_type": "llm"
    }
  ]
}
```



## Running from container

The image with *Lightspeed Core Stack* allow users to run the service in two modes. In the first mode, the *OGX* runs in separate process - in a container or as a local or remote process. *OGX* functions are accessible via exposed TCP port. In the second model, the OGX is used as a standard Python library which means, that only the *Lightspeed Core Stack* image is needed and no other packages nor tools need to be installed.



### Retrieving *Lightspeed Core Stack* image

First, it is needed to get an image containing the *Lightspeed Core Stack* service and all the necessary libraries on which the service depends. It is possible to use the stable release version (like 1.0.0, or "latest" stable), latest development version, or development version identified by a date + SHA (that image is built for any merged pull request).



#### Prerequisites

- `podman` installed and configured properly

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible to use `docker` instead of `podman`, but this use case is not tested and thus not supported.



#### Retrieve the image

Stable release images are tagged with versions like `0.1.0`. Tag `latest` always points to the latest stable release.

Development images are build from main branch every time a new pull request is merged. Image tags for dev images use
the template `dev-YYYYMMMDDD-SHORT_SHA` e.g. `dev-20250704-eaa27fb`.

Tag `dev-latest` always points to the latest dev image built from latest git.

To retrieve the latest dev image, use the following command:

```bash
podman pull quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:dev-latest
```

It should get the image, copy all layers, and write manifest:

```text
Trying to pull quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:dev-latest...

4468f475931a54ad1e5c26270ff4c3e55ec31444c1b0bf8fb77a576db7ab33f1
```

To retrieve stable version `0.2.0`, use the following command:

```bash
podman pull quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:0.2.0
```

```text

```



### OGX used as a separate process

*Lightspeed Core Stack* image can run LCS service that connects to OGX running in a separate process. This means that there will at least be two running processes involved:

1. OGX framework with open port 8321 (can be easily changed if needed)
1. Image with LCS (running in a container) with open port 8080 mapped to local port 8080 (can be easily changed if needed)

![LCS in a container](./lcs_in_container.svg)

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that LCS service will be run in a container. OGX itself can be run in a container, in separate local process, or on external machine. It is just needed to know the URL (including TCP port) to connect to OGX.
> [!INFO]
> If OGX is started from a container or is running on separate machine, you can skip next parts - it is expected that everything is setup accordingly.



#### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.12 or 3.13
1. `pip` tool installed
1. `jq` and `curl` tools installed

#### Installation of all required tools

1. `pip install --user uv`
1. `sudo dnf install curl jq`

#### Installing dependencies for OGX


1. Create a new directory
    ```bash
    mkdir ogx-server
    cd ogx-server
    ```
1. Create project file named `pyproject.toml` in this directory. This file should have the following content:
    ```toml
    [project]
    name = "ogx-demo"
    version = "0.1.0"
    description = "Default template for PDM package"
    authors = []
    dependencies = [
        "ogx==1.2.5",
        "fastapi>=0.115.12",
        "opentelemetry-sdk>=1.34.0",
        "opentelemetry-exporter-otlp>=1.34.0",
        "opentelemetry-instrumentation>=0.55b0",
        "aiosqlite>=0.21.0",
        "litellm>=1.72.1",
        "uvicorn>=0.34.3",
        "blobfile>=3.0.0",
        "datasets>=3.6.0",
        "sqlalchemy>=2.0.41",
        "faiss-cpu>=1.11.0",
        "mcp>=1.9.4",
        "autoevals>=0.0.129",
        "psutil>=7.0.0",
        "torch>=2.7.1",
        "peft>=0.15.2",
        "trl>=0.18.2"]
    requires-python = "==3.12.*"
    readme = "README.md"
    license = {text = "MIT"}


    [tool.pdm]
    distribution = false
    ```
1. Run the following command to install all dependencies:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

    You should get the following output:

    ```ascii

    ```



#### Check if OGX can be started

1. In the next step, we need to verify that it is possible to run a tool called `ogx`. It was installed into a Python virtual environment and therefore we have to run it via `uv run` command:
    ```bash
     uv run ogx
    ```
1. If the installation was successful, the following messages should be displayed on the terminal:
    ```text
    usage: ogx [-h] {model,stack,download,verify-download} ...

    Welcome to the OGX CLI

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    subcommands:
      {model,stack,download,verify-download}

      model                 Work with llama models
      stack                 Operations for the OGX / Distributions
      download              Download a model from llama.meta.com or Hugging Face Hub
      verify-download       Verify integrity of downloaded model files
    ```
1. If we try to run the OGX without configuring it, only the exception information is displayed (which is not very user-friendly):
    ```bash
    uv run ogx stack run
    ```
    Output:
    ```

#### OGX configuration

OGX needs to be configured properly. For using the default runnable OGX a file named `run.yaml` needs to be created. Use the example configuration from [examples/run.yaml](../../examples/run.yaml).



#### Run OGX in a separate process

1. Export OpenAI key by using the following command:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-foo-bar-baz"
    ```
1. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    uv run ogx stack run run.yaml
    ```
1. Check the output on terminal, it should look like:
    ```text

    ```
1. The server with OGX listens on port 8321. A description of the REST API is available in the form of OpenAPI (endpoint /openapi.json), but other endpoints can also be used. It is possible to check if OGX runs as REST API server by retrieving its version. We use `curl` and `jq` tools for this purposes:
    ```bash
    curl localhost:8321/v1/version | jq .
    ```
    The output should be in this form:
    ```json
    {
      "version": "0.2.22"
    }
    ```



#### *Lightspeed Core Stack* configuration to connect to OGX running in separate process

Image with *Lightspeed Core Stack* needs to be configured properly. Create local file named `lightspeed-stack.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Lightspeed Core Service (LCS)
service:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080
  auth_enabled: false
  workers: 1
  color_log: true
  access_log: true
ogx:
  use_as_library_client: false
  url: http://localhost:8321
  api_key: xyzzy
user_data_collection:
  feedback_enabled: true
  feedback_storage: "/tmp/data/feedback"
  transcripts_enabled: true
  transcripts_storage: "/tmp/data/transcripts"

authentication:
  module: "noop"
```



#### Start *Lightspeed Core Stack* from within a container

Now it is needed to run *Lightspeed Core Stack* from within a container. The service needs to be configured, so `lightspeed-stack.yaml` has to be mounted into the container:

```bash
podman run -it --network host -v lightspeed-stack.yaml:/app-root/lightspeed-stack.yaml:Z quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:dev-latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that `--network host` is insecure option. It is used there because LCS service running in a container have to access OGX running *outside* this container and the standard port mapping can not be leveraged there. This configuration would be ok for development purposes, but for real deployment, network needs to be reconfigured accordingly to maintain required container isolation!



### OGX used as a library

OGX can be used as a library that is already part of OLS image. It means that no other processed needs to be started, but more configuration is required. Everything will be started from within the one container:

![Both services in a container](./both_services_in_container.svg)



#### OpenAI key

First, export your OpenAI key into environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-foo-bar-baz-my-key"
```

#### OGX configuration

Create a file named `run.yaml`. Use the example configuration from [examples/run.yaml](../../examples/run.yaml).

### LCS configuration

Create file `lightspeed-stack.yaml` with the following content (unified
mode — the `run.yaml` created above is consumed as the synthesis
[profile](#profiles)):

```yaml
name: Lightspeed Core Service (LCS)
service:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080
  auth_enabled: false
  workers: 1
  color_log: true
  access_log: true
ogx:
  use_as_library_client: true
  config:
    profile: ./run.yaml
  api_key: xyzzy
user_data_collection:
  feedback_enabled: true
  feedback_storage: "/tmp/data/feedback"
  transcripts_enabled: true
  transcripts_storage: "/tmp/data/transcripts"

authentication:
  module: "noop"
```

> [!WARNING]
> The legacy equivalent — `library_client_config_path: ./run.yaml` instead
> of the `config:` block — is deprecated and will be removed in release
> 0.8. See
> [Migrating from the legacy two-file configuration](#migrating-from-the-legacy-two-file-configuration).


### Start *Lightspeed Core Service* from a container

Now it is time to start the service from a container. It is needed to mount both configuration files `lightspeed-stack.yaml` and `run.yaml` into the container. And it is also needed to expose environment variable containing OpenAI key:

```bash
podman run -it -p 8080:8080 -v lightspeed-stack.yaml:/app-root/lightspeed-stack.yaml:Z -v ./run.yaml:/app-root/run.yaml:Z -e OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY} quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:dev-latest
```


## Usage

The *Lightspeed Core Stack* service exposes its own REST API endpoints:

![REST API](./rest_api.svg)

### Using OpenAPI Swagger UI

#### Front page

Open <http://localhost:8080> URL in your web browser. The following front page should be displayed:

![Front page](screenshots/front_page.jpg)

#### Swagger UI

Click on [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/docs) link to open Swagger UI page:

![Swagger UI page](screenshots/openapi_swagger.png)

List of all available REST API endpoints is displayed on this page. It is possible to interactively access any endpoint, specify query parameters, JSON payload etc. For example it is possible to access [Info endpoint](http://localhost:8080/v1/info) and see actual response from the Lightspeed Core Stack service:

![Swagger UI page](screenshots/info_endpoint.png)


#### Sending query to LLM

Some REST API endpoints like `/query` requires payload to be send into the service. This payload should be represented in JSON format. Some attributes in JSON payload are optional, so it is possible to send just the question and system prompt. In this case the JSON payload should look like:

![Swagger UI page](screenshots/openapi_swagger.png)

The response retrieved from LLM is displayed directly on Swagger UI page:

![Swagger UI page](screenshots/openapi_swagger.png)



### Using `curl`

To access Lightspeed Core Stack service functions via REST API from command line, just the `curl` tool and optionally `jq` tool are needed. Any REST API endpoint can be accessed from command line.

#### Accessing `info` REST API endpoint

For example, the [/v1/info](http://localhost:8080/v1/info) endpoint can be accessed without parameters using `HTTP GET` method:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/info | jq .
```

The response should look like:

```json
{
  "name": "Lightspeed Core Service (LCS)",
  "version": "0.2.0"
}
```

#### Retrieving list of available models

Use the [/v1/models](http://localhost:8080/v1/models) to get list of available models:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models | jq .
```

Please note that actual response from the service is larger. It was stripped down in this guide:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "identifier": "gpt-4-turbo",
      "metadata": {},
      "api_model_type": "llm",

      "type": "model",
      "provider_resource_id": "gpt-4-turbo",
      "model_type": "llm"

        "context_length": 8192.0
      },

      "provider_id": "openai",
      "type": "model",
      "provider_resource_id": "text-embedding-3-small",
      "model_type": "llm"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "openai/text-embedding-3-large",
      "metadata": {
        "embedding_dimension": 3072.0,
        "context_length": 8192.0
      },
      "api_model_type": "llm",
      "provider_id": "openai",
      "type": "model",
      "provider_resource_id": "text-embedding-3-large",
      "model_type": "llm"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Retrieving LLM response

To retrieve LLM response, the question (or query) needs to be send to inference model. Thus the `HTTP POST` method should be used:

```bash
$ curl -X 'POST' \
>   'http://localhost:8080/v1/query' \
>   -H 'accept: application/json' \
>   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
>   -d '{
>   "query": "write a deployment yaml for the mongodb image",
>   "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant"
> }'
```

Response should look like:

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "a731eaf2-0935-47ee-9661-2e9b36cda1f4",
  "response": "Below is a basic example of a Kubernetes deployment YAML file for deploying a MongoDB instance using the official MongoDB Docker image.
