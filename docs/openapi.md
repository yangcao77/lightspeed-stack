## QuotaHandlersConfiguration


Quota limiter configuration.

It is possible to limit quota usage per user or per service or services
(that typically run in one cluster). Each limit is configured as a separate
_quota limiter_. It can be of type `user_limiter` or `cluster_limiter`
(which is name that makes sense in OpenShift deployment).

## QuotaLimiterConfiguration


Configuration for one quota limiter.

There are three configuration options for each limiter:

1. ``period`` is specified in a human-readable form, see
   https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-INTERVAL-INPUT
   for all possible options. When the end of the period is reached, the
   quota is reset or increased.
2. ``initial_quota`` is the value set at the beginning of the period.
3. ``quota_increase`` is the value (if specified) used to increase the
   quota when the period is reached.

There are two basic use cases:

1. When the quota needs to be reset to a specific value periodically (for
   example on a weekly or monthly basis), set ``initial_quota`` to the
   required value.
2. When the quota needs to be increased by a specific value periodically
   (for example on a daily basis), set ``quota_increase``.
