# 📋 Components



## A2AStateConfiguration


A2A protocol persistent state configuration.

Configures how A2A task state and context-to-conversation mappings are
stored. For multi-worker deployments, use SQLite or PostgreSQL to ensure
state is shared across all workers.

If no configuration is provided, in-memory storage is used (default).
This is suitable for single-worker deployments but state will be lost
on restarts and not shared across workers.

Attributes:
    sqlite: SQLite database configuration for A2A state storage.
    postgres: PostgreSQL database configuration for A2A state storage.


| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| sqlite |  | SQLite database configuration for A2A state storage. |
| postgres |  | PostgreSQL database configuration for A2A state storage. |

1. ``period`` is specified in a human-readable form, see
   https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-INTERVAL-INPUT
   for all possible options. When the end of the period is reached, the
   quota is reset or increased.
2. ``initial_quota`` is the value set at the beginning of the period.
3. ``quota_increase`` is the value (if specified) used to increase the
   quota when the period is reached.

There are two basic use cases:

1. When the quota needs to be reset to a specific value periodically (for
   example on a weekly or monthly basis), set ``initial_quota`` to the
   required value.
2. When the quota needs to be increased by a specific value periodically
   (for example on a daily basis), set ``quota_increase``.
